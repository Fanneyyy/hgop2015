About Me
=========

## Education
My name is Fanney Sigurðardóttir, a Computer Science student studying at the University of Reykjavík. 
My hometown is Akureyri and I came to Reykjavík in 2011 for school. 
I finished my college degree from VMA in 2007, specializing in the natural sciences. 
In 2008 I began my English studies at the University of Iceland, took one semester at Durham University, 
England and finished my bachelor's degree in 2012.

## Personal Life
I have two children, a nine year old boy and a two year old girl, 
and along with my fiancee, we all really enjoy outdoor activities, hiking, cycling, skiing, snowboarding,
cross-country skiing, camping and such.
I personally also enjoy photography and design, board games, computer games and music, and I'm also specially interested in
all aspects of web development and hope to be able to make some part of it my profession in the future.
In essence I'm a happy, positive, easy-going person. 
I'm hardworking and passionate about learning new skills and I really love the field I'm studying 
so I'm very excited about becoming an excellent computer scientist.

## This course
I decided to enroll in the course Practical Quality Assurance and Testing because I really enjoyed the prerequisite 
Software Engineering. I also saw that we would be setting up a best practices workflow when developing
a web application, including hopefully continuous delivery and a lot of testing that should ensure a good working environment
and a quality product. I am mostly excited about the development of the application, although I know that the application itself
won't be a focus point in the course, I know that the working environment including the testing is extremely important
and I want to adopt all these best practices before I start working since perhaps then I won't have time to.
